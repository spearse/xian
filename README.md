A test framework for creating eXpanding Immersive Audio Networks 

The system allows you create and control small and inexpensive surround sound experiences easily. 

Ease of use is the focus. 

The system is designed around using a single Raspberry PI as a server and then using Pi Zeros as nodes.

A user should be able to insert a usb stick containg files onto the host.
The host should then make a copy of the files to its local storage. This should be a safety feature to ensure users cant damage their files if using an external thumb drive.   

When the copy has completed, connected nodes should be informed so that they can copy the files to their storage.
